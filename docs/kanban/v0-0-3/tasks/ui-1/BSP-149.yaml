description: |
  Deliver a cross-platform desktop app that wraps the web UI with
  native packaging, local runtime integration, and OS-level features.
  This becomes the primary long-lived operator console. The desktop
  app lives in lib/rotappo to keep it independent from Bootstrappo.

deliverables:
  - Desktop shell using Tauri or Dioxus
  - Local runtime bridge (IPC) to avoid remote server setup
  - Packaging and update pipeline for Mac, Linux, and Windows

acceptance_criteria:
  - Desktop app runs against a local runtime without extra config
  - Packaging artifacts are reproducible across supported OS targets
  - Notifications and tray integration support long-running sessions
