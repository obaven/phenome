# ML Models

Phase 1 ML models are heuristic and lightweight:
- Anomaly detection: sigma-based deviation check on recent metrics.
- Scaling prediction: simple moving average of recent history.
- Recommendations: placeholder rules for capacity optimization.

Future work includes isolation forest, ARIMA forecasting, and correlation-based
root cause analysis.
